Tell us a bit about you?</h3>\n<p>Hej! I am Anouk, a Dutchie who returned to Amsterdam half a year ago after a couple of amazing years in Melbourne. Life in Amsterdam is lovely, but I also miss my life and friends in Melbourne. Feels like I have 2 homes now, so I hope to return to Melbs for a (long) holiday soon.</p>\n<p>I have 2 kids (Lasse and Mijs) and am married to Kees. He is a great strategy director (in advertising), lots of fun to be with and a great support while I was juggling work, kids and TGDS. When we got back to Amsterdam I decided to juggle a little less and I focused on finishing the last modules of TGDS before looking for a new job. Felt like such a luxury!</p>\n<p>I love traveling, hanging out with friends (with some food &amp; drinks ;), doing fun stuff with the kids and enjoy exercising a couple of times a week (a healthy habit I developed in Melbourne).</p>\n<!-- \n\n#### Anouk's Personal Branding & Identity\n\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n\n![Stylistic layout of branding for Envelope, CD, Letterheads and Business Cards](./img/anouk-personal-spread.jpg \"Anouk's Branding\")\n\n</div> \n\n-->\n<h4 id=\"daedal-clothing-%7C-branding-and-packaging\">Daedal Clothing | Branding and Packaging</h4>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-daedal-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Daedal logo design by Anouk Moller\" title=\"Daedal Logo Design\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-daedal-shopfront.jpg\" alt=\"A blue logo for the Daedal company is printed on glass door as a woman reads a book inside\" title=\"Daedal Door Print\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-daedal-office.jpg\" alt=\"Paper documentation and branding for Daedal designs\" title=\"Branding for Daedal\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-daedal-wood.jpg\" alt=\"There is a piece of wood with the logo for Daedal burnt into it\" title=\"Daedal Woodburn\">\n<img src=\"./img/anouk-daedal-tag.jpg\" alt=\"A cadboard clothing tag for Daedal\" title=\"Daedal tag\"></p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"inspisrational-hangings\">Inspisrational Hangings</h4>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-kids-1.jpg\" alt=\"A green pastel print with an inspirational quote hanging from cables infront of a grey wall\" title=\"Green Inspirational Poster\">\n<img src=\"./img/anouk-kids-2.jpg\" alt=\"A red pastel print with an inspirational quote hanging from cables infront of a grey wall\" title=\"Red Inspirational Poster\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imagerow\">\n<p><img src=\"./img/anouk-kids-3.jpg\" alt=\"A blue pastel print with an inspirational quote hanging from cables infront of a grey wall\" title=\"Blue Inspirational Poster\">\n<img src=\"./img/anouk-kids-4.jpg\" alt=\"A orange pastel print with an inspirational quote hanging from cables infront of a grey wall\" title=\"Orange Inspirational Poster\"></p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"yup!-bags-%7C-branding-and-packaging\">Yup!

But being the generalist I am, I never really focused on it and ended up studying and doing work that was not really about design. I have worked as a qual market research director for years and years and I was always obsessed with the look and feel of research reports. Mostly these were quite bad (although I do see a shift these last years).</p>\n<p>Anyway, often I would rather spend time on the design elements of a report, while deadlines were approaching fast and I still had to do so much work on the analysis. Our move to Melbourne somehow gave me the confidence and final push to do something about my longing to change my career and learn all about design.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-your-favourite-part-of-the-design-process%3F\">What is your favourite part of the design process?</h3>\n<p>Probably that moment when the first good ideas start to kick in and you feel you are getting there… and confidence is growing that you might actually succeed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-were-really-into-all-sorts-of-design-disciplines-at-tgds%2C-branding%2C-campaigning-and-even-packaging.-have-you-got-a-favourite%3F\">You were really into all sorts of design disciplines at TGDS, branding, campaigning and even packaging. Have you got a favourite?</h3>\n<p>I enjoyed all of them! But yeah, of course there are some favourites. I guess I mostly enjoy logo and corporate design. And I really enjoyed designing the magazine spread and would love to further develop my skills in infographic design.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tell-us-anything-you-would-like-to-about-your-featured-works.\">Tell us anything you would like to about your featured works.</h3>\n<p>A couple of projects really stand out to me, because I personally feel connected to the subjects. I also took a lot of time to develop an interesting and good brief for these projects.</p>\n<p>Like the corporate identity for <strong>Daedal</strong>, which is a fictional shop I made up. It is a furniture manufacturer &amp; retailer that provides a twist and new purpose to depreciated furniture and items. The result is not 2nd hand, in stead it is about using the materials and turning it in something new and unique: ‘the new new’. I would love it if a shop like that existed in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>For the magazine spread, I wrote a review about a mind-blowing book on the future of our planet. This book also inspired my campaign project, about the impact of our purchases on the planet. It is such an urgent but complex subject, so it is interesting to find ways how design can help to trigger people to be interested and ideally change their habits.</p>\n<p>The logo with the giraffe is about the silent extinction of these animals (!), which I had no idea of before doing research on the subject.</p>\n<p>The process of designing my personal identity was great. It took me many steps and phases, but with the support of Lee-Anne and Simone I really got there.</p>\n<p>The JavaLove logo is special to me, as it feels like my first real ‘design project’. And I’m still happy with the result. Looking back at my projects, I do not feel that way about all my projects ;).</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-did-you-love-about-studying-design%3F\">What did you love about studying design?</h3>\n<p>Probably the whole process. Realising how much I was learning along the way, that I was actually able to design and be a designer… that was just great!</p>\n<h3 id=\"you-finished-your-design-course%2C-this-week!-what%E2%80%99s-your-dream-design-job%3F-don%E2%80%99t-hold-back!\">You finished your design course, this week! What’s your dream design job? Don’t hold back!</h3>\n<p>I like variety, so in my ideal world I would do both corporate design for companies as well as helping (research or other) companies to tell their story and messages in a more visual way. I have a lot of experience with analyzing information, so I would also love to combine that with design; for example, to be involved in developing content and structure for a presentation or infographics and then to do the design of it as well.</p>\n<p>I just scored my first project on a freelance basis! Which is actually my ideal combo of analysis and designing the presentation and some infographics. Very happy!</p>\n"}]},{"slug":"courses","permalink":"/courses","pages":[{"permalink":"/courses/certificate-iv-in-design","path":"/courses/certiv"},{"permalink":"/courses/design-at-work","path":"/courses/dw"},{"permalink":"/courses/intensive-foundations","path":"/courses/ifc"},{"permalink":"/courses/web-design-course","path":"/courses/wdc"}],"title":"Courses","layout":"courses","navigation-set":[{"label":"Certificate IV In Design","to":"/courses/certificate-iv-in-design"},{"label":"Design At Work","to":"/courses/design-at-work"},{"label":"Web Design","to":"/courses/web-design"},{"label":"Intensive Foundation","to":"/courses/intensive-foundation"}],"content":[{"permalink":"/courses/certiv","title":"CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design","titleShort":"Certificate IV in Design","tagline":"The mother of all our design courses, hefty design skills with a qualification.

Some students have no immediate plans to undertake further study, yet think it wise for them to keep their options open. Courses teaching specialisations within the design sector may require a qualification in design as a pre-requisite of entry.</li>\n<li>Some design <strong>employment opportunities</strong> lie within a branch of the government sector, where qualifications may be a necessity for employ.</li>\n<li>Not knowing where the future may lead them, will they need that qualification in 5, 10 or even 15 years?</li>\n<li>For <strong>professional development</strong>.

It is also suitable for graphic designers who want to expand their portfolio to include web design, self-taught designers and designers who want to learn how to plan the architecture, how to wireframe a site, and be able to design and create prototypes of a web design; web developers who want to learn about web design and people with an interest in design.</p>\n<p>The course will equip you with all the skills necessary to understand information and interface design, and the ability to plan and design a multi-page website project, for both desktop and mobile. You will learn how to create a wireframe and working prototype of your final web design project using Adobe Experience Design.</p>\n<p>Students have 6 months to complete the course. As the course is entirely self paced students can study online and in their own time. Enrolments are taken all year round any day of the year. The approximate time to complete the course is 200 hours. This varies from student to student.</p>\n<p>There are many job definitions within the web design discipline. A Web Designer is a person who creates the visual elements of websites. Web designers design the overall look for a website and let a Webmaster/Developer do the actual coding. Most often, they are also proficient with Web graphics and images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-design-course-curriculum\">Web Design Course Curriculum</h3>\n<h3 id=\"industry-relevant-learnings\">Industry Relevant Learnings</h3>\n<h4 id=\"what-you-will-learn\">What you will learn</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced understanding of the principles of graphic design for the web/screen environment.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the principles of user–centered design and it’s application in web design.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the principles of information design.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the principles of interface design.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the role of markup languages for web design and what they do.</li>\n<li>Understanding how to design for device specificity.</li>\n<li>Ability to plan and design a multi–page website project, for both desktop and mobile.</li>\n<li>Working with and developing real world web design briefs.</li>\n<li>Designing of Banner Ads in the context of a design system.</li>\n<li>Understanding the application of each Adobe programme and choosing the best one for a specific task.</li>\n<li>How to create a working prototype of your web design using Adobe Experience Design.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what-you-will-not-learn\">What you will not learn</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Back–end development (what is happening on the server).

You will also learn, using Experience Design, how to show a working prototype, within a browser, of your final website.

You will be learning to design web layouts in a range of programmes using your Adobe Creative Suite skills in Illustrator &amp; Adobe Experience Design.
