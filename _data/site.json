This qualification is part of the national vocational education and training (VET) system, competency based and based on Training Packages. There are no pre-requisites of entry into this course. We teach you from the ground up.\n\n### The course ethos\n\n#### More than just software learning\n\nWe teach a mixture of what we call &lsquo;OLD SCHOOL&rsquo; meets &lsquo;NEW SCHOOL&rsquo; techniques that get to the core of what it means to be a real designer:\nan understanding of the culture of design combined with the techniques of a solid design process, from design brief to idea generation, sketching, layout, comp and finishing in the Adobe suite.\n\n#### Online but Intensive\n\nYes intensive. We know what you need to know in order to be a designer, a smart one. So we don’t take any short cuts. Others may teach from a text book, or from a stream of videos. We don’t.\n\n#### Design training designed by industry experts\n\nWe have designed our CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design course to be a comprehensive qualification in graphic design. You will cover 12 modules during the course and be issued a CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design qualification after successfully completing the course.\n\n#### Portfolio plus qualification\n\nThis course is ideal for someone who wishes to obtain a qualification for their skills. Being a portfolio based industry; we feel your skills are the most important aspect to your design training. Whether you need the qualification or not is entirely a personal choice. That’s why we run the qualification and the non-qualification courses.\n\n### Why choose the qualification?\n\n\n#### The reasons our students have cited\n\nOur students and graduates have sited the following reasons for deciding to undertake the CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design over the Intensive Foundation Course. Their reasons may help you in your decision too:\n\n* **Further study**. Some students have no immediate plans to undertake further study, yet think it wise for them to keep their options open. Courses teaching specialisations within the design sector may require a qualification in design as a pre-requisite of entry.\n* Some design **employment opportunities** lie within a branch of the government sector, where qualifications may be a necessity for employ.\n* Not knowing where the future may lead them, will they need that qualification in 5, 10 or even 15 years?\n* For **professional development**. A qualification is required by their employer.\n* Feeling more secure with a qualification\n* As we are **Austudy approved**, students wishing to obtain Austudy, may only do so if enrolled in the qualification.\n\nWe are happy to have a chat to you about the differences in the courses in more detail too. [Contact us](/contact)\n\n#### Self Paced Course\n\nSetting a schedule. Students have up to 15 months to complete the 12 modules.

It is also suitable for graphic designers who want to expand their portfolio to include web design, self-taught designers and designers who want to learn how to plan the architecture, how to wireframe a site, and be able to design and create prototypes of a web design; web developers who want to learn about web design and people with an interest in design.\n\nThe course will equip you with all the skills necessary to understand information and interface design, and the ability to plan and design a multi-page website project, for both desktop and mobile. You will learn how to create a wireframe and working prototype of your final web design project using Adobe Experience Design.\n\nStudents have 6 months to complete the course.

The approximate time to complete the course is 200 hours. This varies from student to student.\n\nThere are many job definitions within the web design discipline.

Programming with PHP. Programming with Javascript\n\n#### Why don&apos;t we teach back&ndash;end development in this course?\n\n*   Back&ndash;end web development is a profession in itself. Web designers and developers communicate with each other and blend their skills to create complete website projects. A back-end and web developer is a software engineer and not a designer.\n\n* You will, however, learn how to prepare your artwork for a developer and know what you need to provide. You will also learn, using Experience Design, how to show a working prototype, within a browser, of your final website. This will be really useful for a developer to see your design and how interaction will work.\n  \nYou can be a complete beginner to web design to undertake this course, as we teach from the ground up. You will be learning to design web layouts in a range of programmes using your Adobe Creative Suite skills in Illustrator & Adobe Experience Design. While Adobe Experience Design will be taught from the ground up, you will need intermediate Illustrator and skills for this course.\n\n#### Costs\n\n[Check out our plans & enrol in the Web Design Course](/enrol)\n\n[Request a quote for your employer: Web Design Course](mailto:accounts@thegraphicdesignschool.com?Subject=Quote%20Request%20-%20Web%20Design%20Course%20&Body=Dear%20Accounts%20team%2C%0A%0ACan%20you%20please%20send%20me%20a%20quote%20for%20the%20Web%20Design%20Course%20%20%0A%0ACompany%20details%3A%0A%0A%0A)\n","bodyBegin":9,"frontmatter":"bimg: 'assets/img/courses/vintage-computing.jpg'\ncanonical: \"courses/web-design-courses\"\nsubtitle: 'Graphic Design for the Web'\ndescription: \"New to the web design world?
