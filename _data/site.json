We know what you need to know in order to be a designer, a smart one. So we don’t take any short cuts. Others may teach from a text book, or from a stream of videos. We don’t.</p>\n<h4 id=\"design-training-designed-by-industry-experts\">Design training designed by industry experts</h4>\n<p>We have designed our CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design course to be a comprehensive qualification in graphic design. You will cover 12 modules during the course and be issued a CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design qualification after successfully completing the course.</p>\n<h4 id=\"portfolio-plus-qualification\">Portfolio plus qualification</h4>\n<p>This course is ideal for someone who wishes to obtain a qualification for their skills. Being a portfolio based industry; we feel your skills are the most important aspect to your design training. Whether you need the qualification or not is entirely a personal choice. That’s why we run the qualification and the non-qualification courses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-choose-the-qualification%3F\">Why choose the qualification?</h3>\n<h4 id=\"the-reasons-our-students-have-cited\">The reasons our students have cited</h4>\n<p>Our students and graduates have sited the following reasons for deciding to undertake the CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design over the Intensive Foundation Course. Their reasons may help you in your decision too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Further study</strong>. Some students have no immediate plans to undertake further study, yet think it wise for them to keep their options open. Courses teaching specialisations within the design sector may require a qualification in design as a pre-requisite of entry.</li>\n<li>Some design <strong>employment opportunities</strong> lie within a branch of the government sector, where qualifications may be a necessity for employ.</li>\n<li>Not knowing where the future may lead them, will they need that qualification in 5, 10 or even 15 years?</li>\n<li>For <strong>professional development</strong>. A qualification is required by their employer.</li>\n<li>Feeling more secure with a qualification</li>\n<li>As we are <strong>Austudy approved</strong>, students wishing to obtain Austudy, may only do so if enrolled in the qualification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are happy to have a chat to you about the differences in the courses in more detail too. <a href=\"/contact\">Contact us</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"self-paced-course\">Self Paced Course</h4>\n<p>Setting a schedule. Students have up to 15 months to complete the 12 modules. As the course is self-paced, you can decide how many hours a week you wish to concentrate on your study.

As the course is entirely self paced students can study online and in their own time. Enrolments are taken all year round any day of the year. The approximate time to complete the course is 200 hours. This varies from student to student.</p>\n<p>There are many job definitions within the web design discipline. A Web Designer is a person who creates the visual elements of websites. Web designers design the overall look for a website and let a Webmaster/Developer do the actual coding.
