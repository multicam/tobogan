We know what you need to know in order to be a designer, a smart one. So we don’t take any short cuts. Others may teach from a text book, or from a stream of videos. We don’t.</p>\n<h4 id=\"design-training-designed-by-industry-experts\">Design training designed by industry experts</h4>\n<p>We have designed our CUA40715 Certificate IV in Design course to be a comprehensive qualification in graphic design.

Their reasons may help you in your decision too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Further study</strong>. Some students have no immediate plans to undertake further study, yet think it wise for them to keep their options open. Courses teaching specialisations within the design sector may require a qualification in design as a pre-requisite of entry.</li>\n<li>Some design <strong>employment opportunities</strong> lie within a branch of the government sector, where qualifications may be a necessity for employ.</li>\n<li>Not knowing where the future may lead them, will they need that qualification in 5, 10 or even 15 years?</li>\n<li>For <strong>professional development</strong>. A qualification is required by their employer.</li>\n<li>Feeling more secure with a qualification</li>\n<li>As we are <strong>Austudy approved</strong>, students wishing to obtain Austudy, may only do so if enrolled in the qualification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are happy to have a chat to you about the differences in the courses in more detail too. <a href=\"/contact\">Contact us</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"self-paced-course\">Self Paced Course</h4>\n<p>Setting a schedule.
